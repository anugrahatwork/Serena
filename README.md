# Serena

Serena is a simple and elegant JavaScript library designed to simplify backend API calls. Inspired by the seamless integration of modern API clients, Serena aims to provide developers with a straightforward, chainable syntax to interact with RESTful APIs. The project is focused on being intuitive and highly customizable, while also providing a powerful toolkit for API interactions.

Currently, **Serena** is in its early stages of development, and this repository doesn't contain any code yet. However, the vision for Serena includes features like:

- Chainable syntax for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other API methods
- Parameterized API requests with custom headers and dynamic inputs
- Synchronization with **Elara** (our database service library) for smooth database interactions
- Support for common API patterns such as filtering, pagination, and sorting

## Features to be developed:
- Chainable methods for making API calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Parameter and body management for API calls
- Integration with Elara to offer seamless synchronization between database services and API requests

## Inspiration
Serena is inspired by popular API client libraries, such as Axios, and aims to build on their simplicity while providing deeper integration with database services like **Elara**. The goal is to make backend API interactions as effortless as possible.
